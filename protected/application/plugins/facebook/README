FACEBOOK PLUGIN
===============
Created by Lee Stone - March 2010

Installation:
- SQL for DB fields can be found in database.sql
- Every storytlr installation requires a facebook application (see facebook developer site for instructions to create this). From this, all we need is the API key
- The following entry needs to be added to the config file:
	;; Facebook Settings
	facebook.api_key=
	facebook.api_secret=

Changes / Enhancements to be made:
1. It currently assumes the user has given permission to the facebook application beforehand
2. It currently require's the Facebook user's ID. I'd like to change this so we can use their username, or verify
3. For each status, it gets any comments which have been made on it and adds them as comments - is this practical? Just at time of adding?
4. Need to add in some error handling for the facebook query
5. The user's name is currently stored in the database at the time the facebook updates are fetched. Should this be put into the status update dynamically so it can be changed?

Dev Notes:
- This plugin currently uses FQL as status.get wasn't available in the PHP library. It also means that the status source is returned as a string, not an ID.
